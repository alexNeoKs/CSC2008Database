<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p>
The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application that enables Tan Tock Seng Hospital to schedule and manage its medical equipment efficiently. The app will allow the hospital staff to book equipment as per their needs, check availability, and receive alerts on equipment maintenance.
</p>


#### Features:
<p>
Equipment booking: The app will provide an easy-to-use interface for hospital staff to book the equipment they need for their procedures, surgeries, or other medical activities.
Availability check: Staff can check the availability of equipment before making a booking, avoiding conflicts with other users.
Equipment details: The app will provide detailed information on each equipment, such as the type, location, availability, and maintenance schedule.
Maintenance alerts: The app will notify staff when an equipment is due for maintenance, ensuring timely upkeep and preventing equipment downtime.
Search and filter: The app will provide a search function to find specific equipment by type, location, availability, and other filters.
User profiles: Each user will have a personal profile with their booking history, preferences, and other information.
</p>

#### Target Audience:
<p>
The target audience for the Equipment Scheduling App includes all staff members of Tan Tock Seng Hospital who require access to medical equipment for their work, such as doctors, nurses, technicians, and other medical personnel. The app will also benefit hospital administrators who need to manage the equipment inventory and maintenance schedules.
